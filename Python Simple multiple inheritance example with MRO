#MRO stands for Method Resolution Order.
#In cooperative (multiple) inheritance, MRO defines the exact order in which Python looks for a method or attribute when you call it on an object.
#MRO decides “who gets called next” when multiple parent classes are involved.

#Simple multiple inheritance example with MRO

class A:
    def process(self):
        print("A")
        super().process()

class B:
    def process(self):
        print("B")
        super().process()

class C:
    def process(self):
        print("C")

class D(A, B, C):
    def process(self):
        print("D")
        super().process()

d = D()
d.process()
